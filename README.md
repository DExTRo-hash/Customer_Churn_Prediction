# Customer_Churn_Prediction
Modelled multiple deep neural networks to fine tune the hyperparameters and find the most accurate model for customer churn prediction
# Overview
This project aims to develop and evaluate multiple deep learning neural network models to predict customer churn in a business or service. Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers discontinue their subscription or usage of a product or service. Accurate prediction of churn is crucial for businesses to identify and retain valuable customers.

In this project, we explore the impact of different hyperparameters, specifically, varying the number of training epochs and learning rates, to find the most accurate predictive model. We conducted a systematic study by training several neural network models, each with distinct combinations of these hyperparameters.

# Key Features
Deep Learning Models: We implemented a variety of deep learning architectures, including feedforward neural networks and recurrent neural networks, to tackle the customer churn prediction problem.

Hyperparameter Tuning: We experimented with different numbers of training epochs and learning rates for each model, fine-tuning these settings to optimize model performance.

Performance Evaluation: We rigorously evaluated the models using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, to assess their predictive capabilities.

Visualization: To gain insights into model training, we visualized the training and validation curves for each model. These visualizations provide a clear understanding of the model's convergence and generalization capabilities.
